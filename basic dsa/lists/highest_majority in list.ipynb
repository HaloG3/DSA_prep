    " version is the **Boyer–Moore Majority Vote Algorithm**.\n",
    "It’s a completely different approach from your dictionary-based solution, but it solves the same problem using **O(1) space** and **O(n) time**.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How it works**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`c = 0`**\n",
    "   This is a **balance counter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Positive → more occurrences of candidate than non-candidate seen so far.\n",
    "   * Zero → candidate has been \"balanced out\" by other elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`can = None`**\n",
    "   This will store the **current candidate** for majority element.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loop over each number (`i`) in `nums`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **If `c == 0`**, that means we currently don’t have a strong candidate, so we set:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     can = i\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   * Then, **update `c`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     c += 1 if can == i else -1\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "     * If the current number equals the candidate → increment counter.\n",
    "     * If it’s different → decrement counter.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why this works**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The majority element appears more than `n/2` times.\n",
    "   * Even if we \"cancel out\" different numbers, the majority element will survive as the last `can` after the loop ends.\n",
