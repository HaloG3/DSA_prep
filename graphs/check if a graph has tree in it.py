'''
You have a graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an integer n and a list of edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.

Return true if the edges of the given graph make up a valid tree, and false otherwise.
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,4]]
Output: true

Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[1,3],[1,4]]
Output: false

Does the given undirected graph form a valid tree?

ðŸ‘‰ A graph is a tree if it satisfies two conditions:

Connected â†’ All nodes must be reachable from any starting node.

Acyclic â†’ No cycle should exist.

So, for n nodes and edges, a valid tree must have:

Exactly n-1 edges (since a tree with n nodes always has n-1 edges).

No cycle.

So the given solution uses Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) to check both conditions:

No cycles.

Single connected component.

Fully connected.

Step by Step for Example 1:

Initially: p = [0,1,2,3,4]

Edge (0,1): union â†’ [1,1,2,3,4] , n=4

Edge (0,2): union â†’ [2,1,2,3,4] , n=3

Edge (0,3): union â†’ [3,1,2,3,4] , n=2

Edge (1,4): union â†’ [3,4,2,3,4] , n=1

âœ… n==1, so itâ€™s a valid tree.

class Solution:
    def validTree(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        def find(x):
            if p[x] != x:      # Path compression
                p[x] = find(p[x])
            return p[x]

        p = list(range(n))     # Initially each node is its own parent

        for a, b in edges:
            if find(a) == find(b):   # If they have the same root â†’ cycle
                return False
            p[find(a)] = find(b)     # Union step
            n -= 1                   # Reduce number of connected components

        return n == 1   # Valid tree if only ONE connected component remains

ðŸ”¹ Why DFS can also solve this

Union-Find is efficient, but DFS can also be used:

Build adjacency list.

Run DFS from node 0:

After DFS finishes, check if all nodes were visited.

If yes â†’ connected.

If not â†’ disconnected â†’ not a tree.
If you encounter a visited node that is not your parent â†’ cycle.

After DFS, check if all nodes are visited (ensures connectedness).
