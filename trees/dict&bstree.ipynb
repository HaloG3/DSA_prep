    "# Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries.\n",
    "https://leetcode.ca/2017-11-05-706-Design-HashMap/\n",
    "\n",
    "### solution: \n",
    "A straightforward approach to implement a hash map is to use chaining with a list of buckets, where each bucket is a list (or linked list) of tuples representing key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since all keys and values are in the range of [0, 1000000], create an array with length 1000001, which has int type. Initially, all the elements in the array are -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the put function, set the value at index key in the array to be value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the remove function, set the value at index key in the array to be -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the get function, simply return the element at index key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the questions which can be asked to the interviewer before implementing the solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For simplicity, are the keys integers only?\n",
    "2. For collision resolution, can we use chaining?\n",
    "3. Do3 we have to worry about load factors?\n",
    "4. Can we assume inputs are valid or do we have to validate them?\n",
    "5. Can we assume this fits memory?\n",
    "## Open addressing with linear probing\n",
    "There are other ways to implement a HashMap beyond the chaining method with buckets. One alternative approach is to use open addressing with linear probing for collision resolution. In this method, when a collision occurs (i.e., two keys hash to the same index), the algorithm probes subsequent indices in the array (wrapping around to the beginning if necessary) until an empty slot (or the key itself, if already present) is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences and Features:\n",
    "- Initialization (__init__): The HashMap is initialized with a fixed-size array (self.data) that stores key-value pairs directly. A special marker (self.DELETED) is used to indicate deleted entries, which is necessary for linear probing to function correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear Probing in put: To insert a new key-value pair, the method computes the index for the key using the _hash function. If the computed index is occupied (by a different key), it linearly probes subsequent indices until an empty slot or the key itself is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieving Values (get): To retrieve a value, the _find helper method is used to locate the key in the array. If found, it returns the associated value; otherwise, -1 is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Removing Entries (remove): To remove a key-value pair, the _find method locates the key, and its slot is marked as deleted using the self.DELETED marker. This allows linear probing to continue working correctly for other keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finding Entries (_find): A helper method that attempts to find the slot containing the specified key, taking into account linear probing and deleted entries. It returns both the index and a boolean indicating whether the key was found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages and Considerations:\n",
    "- Space Efficiency: This approach tends to be more space-efficient compared to chaining, especially when the load factor is low to moderate.\n",
    "- Performance: While open addressing with linear probing can offer good performance for lookups, inserts, and deletions, it may suffer from clustering effects, where consecutive slots become filled, leading to longer probe sequences. Careful management of the load factor and capacity is crucial.\n",
    "- Resizing: To maintain efficient operations, the capacity of the array may need to be increased (and all keys rehashed) when the load factor gets too high. This resizing logic is not included in the above implementation but would be necessary for a production-level HashMap to ensure performance does not degrade with many entries."

    "## Special Case: When Hash Map Complexity Becomes O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "While hash maps are designed for O(1) average-case performance, there are specific scenarios where operations degrade to O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the hash map. Let’s discuss this case clearly for an interviewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario: High Collision Rate Due to Poor Hash Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary reason a hash map’s complexity becomes O(n) is a **poor hash function** that causes many keys to map to the same index, leading to excessive collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What Happens**:\n",
    "  - If the hash function consistently maps different keys to the same index (or a small subset of indices), the hash map behaves like a single linked list (in separate chaining) or requires many probes (in open addressing).\n",
    "  - For example, if all `n` keys hash to the same index, operations like lookup, insertion, or deletion require traversing all `n` elements in that bucket or probing many slots, resulting in O(n) time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why It Happens**:\n",
    "  - **Poor Hash Function Design**: A hash function that doesn’t distribute keys uniformly. For instance, if the hash function for strings only considers the first character, keys like \"apple\", \"ant\", and \"avocado\" might all map to the same index.\n",
    "  - **Adversarial Inputs**: In rare cases, an attacker could craft inputs that exploit the hash function’s weaknesses, causing intentional collisions (e.g., in a denial-of-service attack). Python mitigates this by randomizing hash seeds per session since Python 3.3, but a poorly designed custom hash function could still cause issues.\n",
    "  - **Degenerate Input Patterns**: If keys have a pattern that aligns poorly with the hash function (e.g., all keys are multiples of a number that maps to the same index modulo the table size), collisions increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Contributing Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High Load Factor Without Resizing**:\n",
    "   - If the hash map’s array is not resized when the load factor becomes too high (e.g., too many elements relative to the number of buckets), collisions increase.\n",
    "   - In Python’s `dict`, automatic resizing prevents this, but in a custom implementation with a fixed-size array, a high load factor could lead to many collisions, degrading performance to O(n) for operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Edge Case in Open Addressing**:\n",
    "   - In open addressing (like Python’s `dict`), collisions are resolved by probing other slots. If the table is nearly full or the probing sequence is poorly designed, finding an empty slot or a key can require checking many slots, approaching O(n) in the worst case.\n",
    "   - Example: If the table is 90% full and the probe sequence clusters keys, lookup may need to scan a large portion of the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interview Talking Points\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain this to an interviewer, I’d structure my response as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Acknowledge the Average Case**:\n",
    "   - “Typically, a hash map provides O(1) average-case time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions due to a good hash function that distributes keys evenly and a reasonable load factor.”\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Introduce the Worst Case**:\n",
    "   - “However, in the worst case, the time complexity can degrade to O(n) if the hash function causes many collisions, effectively turning the hash map into a linear search over many elements.”\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Explain the Cause**:\n",
    "   - “This happens when the hash function maps most or all keys to the same index, leading to a single bucket with many elements (in separate chaining) or excessive probing (in open addressing). For example, a poorly designed hash function that always returns the same index would cause all operations to scan through all `n` elements.”\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Provide Context**:\n",
    "   - “In practice, Python’s `dict` mitigates this with a robust hash function and automatic resizing to keep the load factor low. But in a custom implementation or with adversarial inputs, we could see O(n) performance.”\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Connect to Real-World Implications**:\n",
    "   - “This is why hash function design is critical. For instance, in competitive programming or system design, we need to ensure the hash function distributes keys well to avoid performance degradation. Python’s randomization of hash seeds also helps prevent attacks that exploit collisions.”\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Relate to Constraints**:\n",
    "   - “In problems like the sliding window maximum (which we discussed earlier), we used a deque instead of a hash map because the problem required maintaining a maximum in a window, and a hash map wouldn’t help due to its unordered nature and potential collision issues for custom use cases.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mitigation Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid O(n) complexity in hash maps:\n",
    "- **Use a Good Hash Function**: Ensure the hash function distributes keys uniformly. Python’s `hash()` function is designed for this.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Resizing**: Resize the hash table (e.g., double its size) when the load factor exceeds a threshold (Python does this automatically).\n",
    "- **Handle Collisions Effectively**: Use efficient collision resolution (e.g., Python’s open addressing with quadratic probing).\n",
    "- **Test Edge Cases**: In competitive programming, test your hash map with inputs that could cause collisions (e.g., similar keys).\n",
    "- **Consider Alternatives**: For problems sensitive to worst-case performance (e.g., real-time systems), use balanced trees (O(log n) \n",

    "4. If the left child does not exist, process the current node's data and move to its right child.\n",
